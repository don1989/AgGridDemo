# AgGridDemo

## Scenario for flashing rows with different colours based on data:

Open up the project in Visual Studio Code

### In a terminal:

cd ag-grid-demo

npm start


### In the browser:

Select 'Update Name For ID'

Notice the flash is the default green.

Select 'Update Price ID

Notice here it flashes green, however I want it to flash red.
